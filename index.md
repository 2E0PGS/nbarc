## About us

The North Bristol Amateur Radio Club was formed over 30 years ago by people interested in Amateur Radio.

We meet Friday evenings from 7:00pm to 10:00pm.

Activities include training courses, radio operation, talks, contests, constructing and of course socialising.

Who can attend the club? Well anyone that is interested in Radio.
