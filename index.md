Activities include training courses, radio operation, talks, contests, constructing and of course socialising.

### G3XOB David Ellacott Funeral arrangements

#### Details

A Humanist ceremony in celebration of Dave's life will be held on
Wednesday 29th December 2021, 12:00-12:45, at Canford Crematorium,
Canford Lane, Westbury on Trym, Bristol BS9 3PQ.

I ask that everyone take a lateral flow test beforehand, and please do
not attend if you have symptoms, or are positive.

Donations:
No flowers please.
Dave volunteered at the Oxfam Bookshop in Westbury on Trym two
afternoons a week, from 2007 until lockdown hit in March 2020, and Oxfam
is a Charity that was dear to Dave's heart. Also, Dave found the
information and support fromThe British Lung Foundation invaluable. So,
if people would like to make a donation to either Oxfam, or The British
Lung Foundation, Dave would certainly have approved.
Donations can be made via these links:-
