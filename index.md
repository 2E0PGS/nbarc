## About us

The North Bristol Amateur Radio Club was formed over 30 years ago by people interested in Amateur Radio.

We meet Friday evenings from 7:00pm to 10:00pm at the SHE7 building in Braemar Crescent, Filton, Bristol (behind the HSBC bank).

Activities include training courses, radio operation, talks, contests, constructing and of course socialising.

Who can attend the club? Well anyone that is interested in Radio.
