# New shack maintenance

The club has had many shacks over the years. A long time ago it was in the "back rooms" where the smokers used to hang out. _Yes that does tell you something about how long ago we're talking._

Then it was moved to a separate room within the main hall.

More recently we had a basement shack. Which later became semi non-operational due to water ingress.

At the time of writing we're setting up a "new new" up stairs main room shack. This means brand new coax runs of high quality cable, new wall sockets, workbenches, rotator cable and much more.

Below are a few images of the out of hours work Paul (G8YMM), Luke (M3VHV) and myself Peter (2E0PGS) gave a hand with.

Thanks to those who turned up for moral support. Rickie () and Alan (G7DRU).

Our HF beam antenna got a new rotator cable. A visual inspection revealed we need to fix one of the ropes on the reflector.

After swapping rigs around a bit and finally plugging them in we're pleased it all works.
